## About

If you have a disability that prevents you from walking around campus, getting around can be difficult. This is a **Web** app that helps dispatchers of Cornell's CULift to schedule, edit, and manage all CULift and RedRunner rides.

The **Rider App** branch can be found [here](https://github.com/cornell-dti/carriage-rider). The **Driver App** branch can be found [here](https://github.com/cornell-dti/carriage-driver).
