# Single Ride Implementation Status

## ‚úÖ **Working Components**

### Backend API
- **Clean RideType Model**: Proper location schema, removed deprecated fields
- **Single Ride Creation**: `POST /api/rides` with validation
- **Single Ride Deletion**: `DELETE /api/rides/:id` 
- **Single Ride Queries**: `GET /api/rides` with filters
- **Recurring Ride Blocking**: Informative error messages for unsupported features

### Frontend Core Components
- **CreateOrEditRideModal**: Fixed for single rides, blocks recurring
- **DeleteOrEditTypeModal**: Simplified for single ride deletion
- **API Integration**: Proper data structure for single rides

## üéØ **Single Ride API Usage**

### Create Single Ride
```bash
POST /api/rides
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "startLocation": "Cornell Campus Store",
  "endLocation": "Library Tower",
  "startTime": "2024-01-15T10:00:00.000Z",
  "endTime": "2024-01-15T11:00:00.000Z",
  "rider": "rider-id",
  "driver": "driver-id", // optional
  "isRecurring": false,
  "timezone": "America/New_York"
}
```

### Delete Single Ride
```bash
DELETE /api/rides/:rideId
```

### Query Rides
```bash
GET /api/rides?rider=rider-id&schedulingState=unscheduled
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Known Frontend Issues (Non-blocking for Single Rides)**

These components have recurring ride references but don't break single ride functionality:
- `CustomRepeatingRides.tsx` - References deprecated fields
- `RequestRideInfo.tsx` - Uses old recurring logic  
- `RideModal.tsx` - Has recurring display logic
- `RiderScheduleTable.tsx` - Recurring ride expansion logic
- Several table components with deprecated field references

## üöÄ **Ready for Testing**

### Core Single Ride Operations That Should Work:
1. **Create**: Use CreateOrEditRideModal (blocks recurring attempts)
2. **View**: Basic ride display in tables
3. **Delete**: Use DeleteOrEditTypeModal (simplified for single rides)
4. **Update**: Edit existing single rides

### Test Scenario:
1. Open ride creation modal
2. Fill in pickup/dropoff locations and times
3. Submit (should create single ride successfully)
4. View created ride in ride list
5. Delete ride using cancel button

## üìã **Next Steps (When Ready for Recurring Rides)**

1. Implement RFC 5545 RRULE parsing
2. Fix frontend components with deprecated field references
3. Add recurrence UI components
4. Implement parent-child ride relationship logic
5. Add timezone-aware date calculations

## üõ°Ô∏è **Safety Features**

- All recurring ride attempts show user-friendly error messages
- Deprecated API endpoints return informative errors
- Frontend blocks recurring ride creation with alerts
- Backend validates single ride requirements

---

**Status**: Single rides are ready for production use. Recurring ride infrastructure is in place but disabled for safety.
