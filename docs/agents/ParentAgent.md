## Parent Documentation Agent Brief

### Objective
Deliver an end-to-end documentation set for the codebase: architecture, module guides, API contracts, data models, and developer workflows.

### Scope Map
- Frontend (`frontend/src`): components, pages, contexts, hooks, icons, services, types, utilities.
- Server (`server/src`): app bootstrap, routers, models, utilities, tests.
- Build & Ops: Docker, compose, Procfile, build artifacts.
 - Functional Workflows: rides lifecycle, booking, driver ops, rider experience, scheduling, notifications, admin ops.

### Deliverables
- `docs/output/Architecture.md`: High-level architecture and data flow diagrams (ASCII acceptable).
- `docs/output/Frontend.md`: Overview with links to component and state docs.
- `docs/output/Server.md`: Overview with links to models and APIs docs.
- `docs/output/BuildOps.md`: Build, environments, deployment, and local dev.
- Cross-referenced sub-docs generated by sub-agents.
 - Functional workflow docs under `docs/output/workflows/*.md`.

### Canonical Sources
- Frontend root: `/Users/atikpui/Desktop/Programming/DTI/carriage-web/frontend/src`
- Server root: `/Users/atikpui/Desktop/Programming/DTI/carriage-web/server/src`

### Standards
- Use consistent headings and checklists from sub-agent briefs.
- Link files with absolute repo paths in backticks.
- Record assumptions; mark TODOs with an owner sub-agent.

### Outline for Architecture.md
1. Repository layout
2. Runtime architecture (frontend <-> server)
3. Data lifecycle: request -> store -> UI -> mutations
4. Authentication flow
5. Error handling and logging
6. Configuration and environments

### Coordination Plan
- Kick off all sub-agents in parallel.
- Aggregate outputs and ensure cross-links are valid.
- Run a consistency pass (naming, formatting, anchor links).
 - Ensure each functional workflow doc maps to components, contexts, models, and API routes.

### Checklists
- [ ] Repo layout verified against filesystem
- [ ] Diagrams reflect actual modules and calls
- [ ] Authentication matched across client/server
- [ ] All public endpoints documented with request/response
- [ ] All models mapped to APIs and UI usage
