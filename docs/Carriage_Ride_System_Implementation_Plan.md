# Carriage Ride System Implementation Plan
**Full System Replacement Strategy**

Version: 1.0
Date: September 15, 2025
Project: Complete migration from current simple ride system to advanced RideSeries-based system

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines the complete replacement of the current Carriage ride system with a sophisticated new system featuring complex recurrence patterns, virtual/physical ride concepts, and RFC 5545-compliant scheduling. The migration represents a fundamental architectural shift from simple CRUD operations to a multi-tier system with RideSeries, materialization processes, and advanced state management.

**Key Changes:**
- **Current System**: Basic ride CRUD with simple recurrence
- **New System**: RideSeries templates, Virtual/Physical rides, RFC 5545 recurrence, three-tier CRUD operations
- **Impact**: Complete frontend and backend replacement with minimal user disruption
- **Timeline**: 5-6 phases over 16-20 weeks

## Migration Strategy

### Approach: Parallel Development with Feature Flagging

1. **Dual System Operation**: Build new system alongside current system
2. **Feature Flags**: Control rollout of new features per user role/group
3. **Data Migration Pipeline**: Transform existing ride data to new schema
4. **Gradual Cutover**: Phase out old system components systematically
5. **Rollback Capability**: Maintain ability to revert if critical issues arise

### Risk Mitigation
- Maintain current system functionality during migration
- Implement comprehensive testing at each phase
- Use feature flags for controlled rollout
- Prepare data rollback procedures

### Migration Scripts

**Existing Recurring Rides → RideSeries:**
```typescript
// Pseudo-migration logic
for each recurring ride group {
  createRideSeries({
    riderId: group.riderId,
    recurrenceRule: parseExistingPattern(group.pattern),
    templateStartTime: group.startTime,
    startLocation: group.startLocation,
    endLocation: group.endLocation
  });

  for each instance in group {
    if (instance.modified) {
      addToExceptionDates(series, instance.date);
      createStandaloneRide(instance); // Orphaned ride
    }
  }
